    A token with word, part of speech, plus "tweaked word" (what the
    token should be treated as when aligning with corpus), and offset
    (some tokens should skip parts of the text)

    This intermediary class should only be used within the educe library
    itself. The context is that we sometimes want to align PTB
    annotations (see `educe.external.postag.generic_token_spans`)
    against text which is almost but not quite identical to
    the text that PTB annotations seem to represent. For example, the
    source text might have sentences that end in abbreviations, like
    "He moved to the U.S." and the PTB might annotation an extra full
    stop after this for an end-of-sentence marker. To deal with these,
    we use wrapped tokens to allow for some manual substitutions:

    * you could "delete" a token by assigning it an empty tweaked word
      (it would then be assigned a zero-length span)
    * you could skip some part of the text by supplying a prefix
      (this expands the tweaked word, and introduces an offset which
      you can subsequentnly use to adjust the detected token span)
    * or you could just replace the token text outright

    These tweaked tokens are only used to obtain a span within the text
    you are trying to align against; they can be subsequently discarded.
