    Given a dependency tree node and its children, return an order on
    the list of children, that should fulfill an inside-out traversal
    on either side.

    Let's back up a little bit for some background on this criterion.
    We assume that dependency tree nodes can be characterised and
    ordered by their position in the text. If we did such a thing, the
    head node would sit somewhere between its children ::

        lX, .., l2, l1, h, r1, r2, .., rY

    An inside-out traversal is one in which moves strictly outward
    from the centre node. Note that this does not imply any other
    requirement on the order our traversal (particularly on left vs
    right), so `h l1 l2 .. lX r1 r2, etc` is as much a valid
    inside-outside traversal as `h l1 r1 l2 etc`; however,
    `h l2 l1 etc` is right out.

    The ranking is determined by a strategy. Currently implemented
    strategies are:
    - 'id': stable sort that keeps the original interleaving, as
    defined below,
    - 'lllrrr': all left then right dependents,
    - 'rrrlll': all right then left dependents,
    - 'lrlrlr': alternating directions, left first,
    - 'rlrlrl': alternating directions, right first.

def deptree_to_simple_rst_tree(dtree, allow_forest=False):
    r"""
    Given a dependency tree with attachment ranking and nuclearity,
    return a 'SimpleRSTTree'.
    Note that nodes are ordered by text span, so that `e1 -R-> e2` and
    `e2 -R-> e1` would both be interpreted as `R(e1, e2)`, the
    potential difference being which is treated as the nucleus and as
    the satellite.

    The conversion algorithm can be seen a two-pass descent/conversion,
    ascent/assembly one. First, we go down the dependency tree,
    annotating each node with a trivial RST tree (ie. a leaf node).
    Then, we walk back up the dependency tree, connecting RST treelets
    together, gradually replacing nodes with increasingly larger RST
    trees.

    The first tricky part of this conversion is to keep in mind
    that the conversion process involves some rotation, namely
    that this dependency structure ::

           R
        a ---> b

    (if we gloss over nuclearity and node order details) is rotated
    into something that looks like this ::


        R +-> a                                 R
          |          (or more conventionally,  / \ )
          +-> b                               a   b


    Where things get tricky is if a node in the dependency tree
    points has multiple children ::

            r1
        src +--> tgt1
            |
            |r2
            +--> tgt2
            |
            ..
            |
            |rN
            +--> tgtN


    In that case, having pivoted the `src(r1:tgt1)` link into something
    like `r1(src, tgt)`, it may not be so clear how to deal with
    subsequents targets `tgt2..tgtN`. We want to both reflect that `src`
    has a dependency link with all of these targets at the same time
    even though it's stuck as an RST child node. The trick is to see the
    process as more of a fold than a map. Keeping in mind that `src`,
    `tgt1..tgtN` are all RST treelets (`tgt1..tgtN` having been built up
    from recursive descent), the idea is to gradually replace the src
    node with an increasingly nested RST tree as we go along ::


        +----------+
        |   r1     |    r2
        |  /  \    + -+---> tgt2
        | src tgt1 |  |
        +----------+  | r3
                      +---> tgt3
                      |
                      ..
                      | rN
                      +---> tgtN



        +------------+
        |     r2     |
        |    /  \    |
        |   r1  tgt2 |    r3
        |  /  \      + -+---> tgt3
        | src tgt1   |  |
        +------------+  ..
                        | rN
                        +---> tgtN


    (and so on, until all we have left is a single RST tree).

    TODO
    ----
    * [ ] fix the signature of this function: change name or arguments
          or return type, because the current implementation returns
          either a SimpleRSTTree if allow_forest=False, or a list of
          SimpleRSTTree if allow_forest=True. This is a likely source of
          errors because SimpleRSTTrees are list-like, ie. tree[i]
          returns the i-th child of a tree node...

        full RST tree for src (through the folding process
        described in the docstring for the main function)
        before connecting it to its ancestor.

        Parameters
        ----------
        ancestor : SimpleRSTTree
            SimpleRSTTree of the ancestor

        subtree : int

        Returns

            SimpleRSTTree covering ancestor and subtree.
